This code was created by the Claude AI LLM.  8/2025

This repository contains both the Python code.
You need an IDE (VSCode) and the following Python libraries installed:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
from matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg import FigureCanvasTkAgg
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk, messagebox, scrolledtext
from collections import defaultdict, Counter
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import threading
import warnings

i'd suggest using pyinstaller to conver the sources code to a Windows executable
